    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      Falafel (pronounced "fell-off-uhl"), sometimes spelled "felafel" or
      "felafil," is a deep-fried ball or patty that is made from either
      chickpeas or fava beans and spices. It is a vegetarian and vegan food and
      one of the most widely consumed and recognized foods of the Middle East.
      It's a very popular fast food around the world, and vendors sell it on the
      street corners in countries like Egypt, Syria, and Israel, where it's the
      national dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falafel is a favorite among vegetarians with its crisp outside and tender
      inside with a mildly spiced flavor thanks to the garlic, parsley, and
      spices. The spices are a key aspect and can be personalized to taste. Make
      sure you leave enough time to soak the dried chickpeas overnight before
      mixing up your batter and frying.
    </p>

      As a main dish, falafel is often served as a sandwich, stuffed in pita
      bread with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini. As an appetizer, it can be
      served on a salad or with hummus and tahini. It's also often served with
      hot sauce(<em>The Spruce Eats, </em>"Classic Homemade Falafel").
