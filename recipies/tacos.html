    <p>
      Finding the perfect, juicy shredded chicken for tacos doesn't have to mean
      a trip to the store. This homemade stovetop method is easy and creates the
      perfect base for delicious tacos. Chicken breasts get a quick sear and
      then simmer in a covered skillet until tender and easy to shred. After
      that, stir in taco seasoning for a flavorful shredded chicken taco layered
      with cheese, sliced radishes, cilantro and salsa verde inside a crunchy
      taco shell. The more ways to make tacos, the tastier every week will be.
      Use this method for your other favorite shredded chicken recipes, too!(<em
